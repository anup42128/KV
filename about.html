                    <p>Welcome to Class Voice, a student feedback portal designed to enhance communication and learning experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p>This platform has been created with one clear goal: to give students a simple space to share and reflect on feedback every day. Feedback is a powerful tool. It helps teachers understand students better, improves communication between educators and learners, and ensures that everyone's voice is heard in building a positive learning environment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike traditional paper-based feedback, which is difficult to manage and track, this digital portal allows quick, organized, and transparent sharing of opinions. Every day, students can log in and record their thoughts on classes, activities, and the learning environment. Educators can then view these insights and make improvements that truly benefit the whole learning community.</p>

                            <p>Hello! üëã My name is <strong>Anup Rai</strong>, and I am a student passionate about improving educational communication. I created this project because I wanted to make feedback collection more meaningful and digital. As students, our thoughts and suggestions matter, but often they are lost in busy schedules or paperwork. Through this website, I aim to give every student a chance to speak up and contribute to the betterment of their learning experience.</p>

                            <p>While I coded the website myself, I am grateful to my friends Niladri Chatterjee and Mohit Kumar Shaw for their valuable suggestions and support throughout the development process. Their ideas helped me make the project better and more user-friendly.</p>
                            
                            <p>This project is also a part of my personal learning journey. I enjoy building websites, learning about technology, and creating solutions that make daily life easier. By combining my interest in programming with the needs of educational institutions, I developed this portal as a step towards smarter learning environments.</p>
