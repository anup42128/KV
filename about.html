                    <p>Welcome to the official Feedback Portal of PM SHRI Kendriya Vidyalaya Barrackpore (AFS).</p>
                    
                    <p>This platform has been created with one clear goal: to give students and teachers a simple space to share and reflect on feedback every day. Feedback is a powerful tool. It helps teachers understand students better, improves communication between school and learners, and ensures that everyone's voice is heard in building a positive learning environment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike traditional paper-based feedback, which is difficult to manage and track, this digital portal allows quick, organized, and transparent sharing of opinions. Every day, students can log in and record their thoughts on classes, activities, and the school environment. Teachers and administrators can then view these insights and make improvements that truly benefit the whole school.</p>

I created this project because I wanted to make feedback collection more meaningful and digital. As students, our thoughts and suggestions matter, but often they are lost in busy schedules or paperwork. Through this website, I aim to give every student a chance to speak up and contribute to the betterment of our school.</p>
                            
                            <p>This project is also a part of my personal learning journey. I enjoy building websites, learning about technology, and creating solutions that make daily life easier. By combining my interest in programming with the needs of our school, I developed this portal as a step towards smarter schooling.</p>
