PURPOSE</h3><p>The purpose of ClassVoice.live is to provide a digital platform for students to communicate constructively within their school community. The platform facilitates sharing of ideas, feedback, and experiences in a responsible and respectful manner. Use of this platform is strictly limited to educational and institutional purposes. Any use beyond this scope may result in account restrictions or removal.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>2. USE OF THE PLATFORM</h3><p>ClassVoice.live is meant to be a positive and respectful space for students to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to school life. Every user is expected to use the platform responsibly and communicate in a kind, honest, and constructive way. Students should avoid using disrespectful language, spreading false information, or posting content that may hurt others or go against school values. Anonymous feedback and complaints should be genuine and focused on improving the school environment. While Team UNI and ClassVoice.live encourage open expression, they are not responsible for user-generated content. However, the team may review or remove content that is found to be inappropriate or harmful to maintain a safe and respectful atmosphere for everyone.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>3. USER ACCOUNTS</h3><p>Some features of ClassVoice.live may require students to create an account using their school email or unique ID. Users are responsible for keeping their account details private and secure. Sharing login information or using someone else’s account is not allowed. Each account represents a student’s personal space for communication, so it should be used only by the rightful owner. Team UNI and ClassVoice.live do not take responsibility for any issues caused by shared or misused accounts. If you notice any unusual activity or believe your account has been accessed by someone else, you should report it immediately to the site support or your school representative so that appropriate steps can be taken to protect your privacy and safety.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>4. PRIVACY</h3><p>ClassVoice.live values the privacy and safety of every student. Any personal information shared on the platform, including feedback or anonymous complaints, is treated as confidential and is only accessible to authorized school staff when necessary for resolving issues or improving the school environment. The platform does not share, sell, or disclose any personal data to outside parties. Anonymous submissions remain anonymous, and names or details are never revealed without the student’s consent. While ClassVoice.live takes reasonable measures to protect user data, no online platform can guarantee complete security. Users are advised to avoid posting private or sensitive details publicly. By using this platform, you agree to communicate responsibly and understand that your privacy is respected at every step.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>5. CONTENT OWNERSHIP</h3><p>All content shared by students on ClassVoice.live, including posts, feedback, and ideas, remains the property of the user who created it. By submitting content on the platform, users give ClassVoice.live permission to display, store, or use it within the platform and school community for educational and communication purposes. The platform does not claim ownership of user submissions and respects the original creator’s rights. However, ClassVoice.live reserves the right to review, moderate, or remove any content that is found to be disrespectful, harmful, or against school values. Users are encouraged to post responsibly, ensuring that their content is respectful, relevant, and does not violate the privacy or rights of others.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>6. SCHOOL AND ADMIN RIGHTS</h3><p>To maintain a safe and respectful environment, the school administration and ClassVoice.live team have the right to review posts, feedback, or complaints submitted on the platform. This helps ensure that all communication follows school values and community guidelines. If any content is found to be harmful, inappropriate, or against the purpose of the platform, the school or admin team may edit, hide, or remove it without prior notice. In cases of repeated misuse or violation of these Terms, a user’s access may be temporarily or permanently restricted. These actions are taken only to protect users and uphold a positive space for learning and expression. The goal of these rights is not to limit voices but to ensure that every student feels safe and respected while using ClassVoice.live.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>7. UPDATES AND CHANGES</h3><p>ClassVoice.live may update or modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time to improve the platform or follow new school policies and digital safety standards. Whenever important updates are made, a notice may be shared on the website or through school communication channels. By continuing to use the platform after such updates, users agree to follow the revised Terms. Students and staff are encouraged to review this section periodically to stay informed about any changes. The goal of these updates is always to make ClassVoice.live a safer, more effective, and more supportive space for everyone.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>8. CONTACT AND SUPPORT</h3><p>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, you can share them directly through the Complaint or Feedback Box available on ClassVoice.live. This section is designed to safely communicate issues, ideas, or improvements without needing to reveal your name or personal information. All submissions are reviewed respectfully and forwarded to the appropriate school staff when necessary. The purpose of this system is to make it easy for every student to be heard and to help improve the school community in a safe, supportive way.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>9. REMOVAL TIME</h3><p>ClassVoice.live is managed by a small team that works carefully to keep the platform respectful and safe for everyone. While we try our best to review and remove inappropriate or harmful feedback as soon as possible, this process may take some time. Every report or complaint is reviewed thoughtfully to ensure fairness and accuracy before any action is taken. We appreciate users’ patience and understanding while the team handles such matters responsibly.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>10. LANGUAGE AND RESPECTFUL COMMUNICATION</h3><p>Students are welcome to use their mother tongue or any language they are comfortable with while sharing thoughts or feedback on ClassVoice.live. The platform encourages open and inclusive communication that reflects the diversity of our school community. However, using abusive, disrespectful, or offensive language toward anyone is strictly not allowed. Any post or feedback containing such words may be reviewed and deleted to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all users. Freedom of expression is supported, but kindness and respect must always come first.</p></div><div class="terms-section"><h3>11. DIFFERENT SCHOOLS</h3><p>ClassVoice.live is designed for use within one school community at a time. Each school will have its own dedicated page or section on the platform to ensure privacy, safety, and relevant discussions among its students and teachers. Users are requested to use only the page or link created for their respective school and not access or post on pages belonging to other schools. This helps keep communication focused, secure, and meaningful for each school community. In the future, ClassVoice.live may expand to additional schools, but each will always have a separate space for its users.</p></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="dashboard.html" class="back-btn"><span class="btn-icon">←</span> Back to Dashboard </a></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-left"><div class="footer-school-info"><h3>Class Voice</h3><p>Student Feedback Portal</p><div class="parent-company"><span class="powered-by">Powered by</span><span class="company-name">UNI</span><span class="company-tagline">Unified Intelligence</span></div></div><p class="footer-description"> Fostering excellence in education through open communication and continuous improvement. </p></div><div class="footer-right"><div class="contact-info"><h4>Contact Information</h4><div class="contact-item"><span class="contact-icon">📧</span><span>feedback@classvoice.edu</span></div><div class="contact-item"><span class="contact-icon">📍</span><span>Educational Feedback Platform</span></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>&copy; 2025 Class Voice by UNI (Unified Intelligence).
